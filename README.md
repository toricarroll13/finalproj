Throughout this project we came across a lot of problems with how we would format the adventure game and the outcomes from each choice. Organizing everything and making sure we had the correct number of outcomes and paths was a bit overwhelming at first but once we wrote everything down it was fine. We also ran into some issues with the format of the main function since we had to call other mini functions within the main one in order for the user to continue on or die and restart the game. 

Completing this project taught us a lot. We realized that as our code got longer and more complex, more planning and debuging was needed. It also taught us good organization skills since we needed to come up with a plan with the correct number of paths to outcomes so that we wouldn't run into syntax errors or other user issues. 

We really enjoyed the freedom we had with this project. Once we settled on doing the adventure game, coming up with the scenarios and outcomes was fun because we were able to be creative with our code.
